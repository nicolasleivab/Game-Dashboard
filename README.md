# Interactive Dashboard for Robo3 game

This project's aim is the design, development and implementation of a visualization system as an interactive WebApp dashboard for the game Robo3, which is an applied game for teaching introductory programming. You can see the [software development report](https://github.com/nicolasleivab/Robo3-Game-Dashboard/blob/master/Software_Development_Report.pdf) for more details, as well as a live [Demo](https://robo3-dashboard.netlify.com).

The goal of the interactive dashboard is to collect and process the data from each student performance from a remote game log and display it to two types of users: students and the instructor in charge. In order to achieve this, several procedures are needed:

* **Requirements Specification** - What specific problems will the system solve? - This depends on each user needs - How will the user interact with the system in order to make a decision?

* **Architectural Design** - Decompose the problem to be solved into several components (elements of the dashboard)

* **Component Design** - Select the best visualizations and interactions for each component according to the user

* **Implementation** - Actual coding

* **Component Testing** - Debugging

* **User Evaluation** - User testing and feedback

* **Documentation and fixes**

## Built With
